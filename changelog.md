# Changelog

* **29 May 2019:** You can now start client-workers instances for cloud deployments using the [Launcher](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/operate/launcher).
* **4 Apr 2019:** Promoted the flexible project layout to beta maturity. This changelog here will only list changes to the example project going forward. Please refer to the [Changelog](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/flexible-project-layout/introduction#changelog) section of our documentation website for updates on the flexible project layout feature in the future.
* **1 Apr 2019:**
  * Moved `workerflags` from the launch configuration file to worker configuration files.
  * Renamed the `launchConfig` field to `launchConfiguration` in spatialos.json.
  * Field `snapshot.takeSnapshotIntervalSeconds` in the lauch configuration file now always defaults to 0 if not set (it previously defaulted to 600 in some cases).
* **27 Mar 2019:** Moved all documentation to our [documentation website](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/flexible-project-layout/introduction). Please refer to the documentation website for FPL related documentation from now on.
* **21 Mar 2019:** We now always regenerate the C# component code for workers when building a worker.
* **13 Mar 2019:**
  * Made the `loadBalancing` field in launch configs optional.
  * The `spatial alpha cloud upload` command is now always registered.
  * [Breaking]: The launch config filepath specified in `spatialos.json` is now relative to the `spatialos.json` file.
  * [Breaking]: We now stop looking for a hardcoded `snapshot/default.snapshot` file when starting a deployment. The starting snapshot must be either specified in a config file or passed as a CLI flag.
* **28 Feb 2019:** 
  * Renamed "current project layout" (CPL), our term for referring to the [prevalent format for structuring SpatialOS projects](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/reference/project-structure), to "structured project layout" (SPL). 
  * Made the `layer` field in [client configurations](reference/client-worker-configuration.md) and [worker configurations](reference/server-worker-configuration.md) mandatory. The previously supported `attributeSet` field has been removed.
  * Fixed a bug where you cannot start a deployment when no workers are defined in your project.
* **25 Feb 2019:** 
  * Added a `convert_snapshot.sh` script to `SpatialOS/scripts/` to demonstrate how to use the [snapshot converter tool](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/shared/operate/snapshots#using-the-snapshot-converter-directly).
  * Added a `default.txt` file to `SpatialOS/snapshots`. The file is the text format representation of `defualt.snapshot`.
* **25 Feb 2019:**
  * Added a `build.sh` script for each worker type so that you can build them individually.
  * Added a `download_dependencies.sh` script to `SpatialOS/scripts/` for downloading the project dependencies from the SpatialOS SDK.
  * Added a `generate-schema-descriptor.sh` script to `SpatialOS/scripts/` for generating a schema descriptor from the project schema. 
  * Added a `utils.sh` script to `SpatialOS/scripts` for defining various paths and methods to be used when building the project.
  * Added a `build-project.sh` script to `SpatialOS/scripts/` for fully building the project.
  * Removed `build.sh` and `clean.sh` from `SpatialOS/`.
  * Moved `deployment.json` from `SpatialOS/` to `SpatialOS/launch_configs/`.
  * Modified the `*.csproj` of all worker projects so that all dependencies point to files inside the worker directory.
  * Flattened all worker type folders into the top directory and modified `SpatialOS/spatialos.json` to reflect the changes.
* **22 Feb 2019:**
  * Added the [Building a worker executable](build-process/worker-build-process.md) documentation page.
  * Added the [Building a schema descriptor](build-process/schema-descriptor-build-process.md) documentation page.
  * Added the [Migration guide](migration-guide/migration-guide-master-page.md) documentation page.
  * Added the [Converting project configuration files](migration-guide/configs-conversion-guide.md) documentation page.
* **15 Feb 2019:**
  * `spatial local launch`, `spatial cloud upload` and `spatial cloud launch` no longer work with FPL projects anymore. Please use the respective `alpha` commands (`spatial alpha local launch`, `spatial alpha cloud upload` and `spatial alpha cloud launch`) going forward.
  * Changed the signature of the `spatial alpha cloud upload` and `spatial alpha cloud launch` CLI commands: Replaced all positional arguments with mandatory flags. For more information, please run the commands with the `--help` flag.
  * Removed the `--optimize_for_runtime_v2` CLI flag and added a new `--using_old_loadbalancer` flag for `spatial alpha local launch`. We now optimize for the [new Runtime](https://docs.improbable.io/reference/latest/releases/upgrade-guides/upgrade-runtime) by default. Please set the `--using_old_loadbalancer` flag if you want to start a local deployment with the old Runtime.
  * Merged the content of the world configuration file (`world.json`) into the [launch configuration](reference/launch-configuration.md). We no longer support using the world configuration file. We also removed the `--world` flag from `spatial alpha local launch` and `spatial alpha cloud launch`.
  * Added a `streamingQueryInterval` field to the [launch configuration](reference/launch-configuration.md).
  * Added a `launchConfig` field in the [project configuration](reference/project-configuration.md).
  * Added `loginRateLimit` and `connectionCapacityLimit` fields to the [client-worker configuration](reference/client-worker-configuration.md).
  * Added `launcherCommand` and `launcherArguments` fields to the `uploadConfiguration` section of the [client-worker configuration](reference/client-worker-configuration.md).
* **03 Feb 2019:** 
  * Moved the snapshot file from `./shared`  to `./SpatialOS/snapshots`.
  * Added this changelog.
  * Added a known issues section to the [readme](../README.md#known-issues).
  * Added a [FAQ section](migration-guide/faq.md).
  * Upgraded the deployment launch configuration to use the `small` template.
* **29 Jan 2019:** Upgraded code examples to use `spatial alpha local launch`, `spatial alpha cloud upload` and `spatial alpha cloud launch`.
* **22 Jan 2019:** Upgraded worker SDK version to `13.5.1`.
* **21 Jan 2019:** Added an upload configuration to the client-worker.
